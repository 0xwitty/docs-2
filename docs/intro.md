# Introduction

Farcaster is a [sufficiently decentralized](https://www.varunsrinivasan.com/2022/01/11/sufficient-decentralization-for-social-networks) social network. It is an open protocol that can support many clients, just like email. Users will always have the freedom to move their social identity between applications, and developers will always have the freedom to build applications with new features on the network. 

On Farcaster, you can broadcast short text messages and connect your Ethereum address. Verifying ownership of an address enables features like showcasing your NFT’s and using an NFT as a verified profile picture. Farcaster is a skin-in-the-game social network that’s not just about what you say but also about what you can prove on-chain.

Anyone can build a client application to broadcast messages on the Farcaster network. We have a [tutorial](./fetch-casts) that will show you how to build a simple app to read messages from any user. We’re also building the first client application to make it easy for people to get started, which is in beta.
